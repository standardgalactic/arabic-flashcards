# A New Theory of Reality: 5 Ideas That Could Change How You See the World

What are you?

We experience ourselves as solid, enduring beings in a world of separate objects. We are the subject; the world is the object. But a breathtaking new academic monograph, ***The Ontology of Self-Organizing Forms***, argues this is a profound illusion. It suggests we are not things at all, but persistent patterns in a universal flow—not nouns, but verbs.

This dense, highly technical work proposes a radical, unified theory of reality, grounded in a new physics of fields called the **Relativistic Scalar–Vector Plenum (RSVP)**. It weaves together physics, information theory, and logic to argue that matter, life, and mind are not separate domains but different expressions of a single underlying geometry.

This post distills five of the most perspective-shattering takeaways from this complex theory.

## 1. The Boundary That Defines “You” Isn’t a Wall — It’s an Inevitable Geometric Consequence

We live inside a boundary. Science calls this a **Markov blanket**—the informational membrane separating an internal “self” from the external “world.” Every sensation and every action must pass through it.

We tend to think of this as something biology invented: a cell wall, a skin surface, a nervous system.

The theory argues the exact opposite.

A Markov blanket is **not** a special biological structure; it is:

> “an unavoidable feature of the geometry of field evolution.”

Wherever RSVP’s fundamental fields settle into a stable, coherent pattern, a boundary **must** form around it. This isn’t optional—it is mathematically required.

This means:

* The separation between self and world is not a biological fluke.
* It is a *necessary consequence of physics.*
* The universe **must carve out selves** whenever stable patterns arise.

Your sense of being a distinct “I” is not mystical; it is baked into the geometry of the cosmos.

## 2. Physics, Information, and Meaning Are Just Different Languages for the Same Thing

Once physics forces a boundary into existence, we can describe the inside–outside relationship in several ways:

* physical field dynamics (RSVP)
* bubble combinatorics (Spherepop)
* semantic compression and inference (Yarncrawler)
* the Free Energy Principle (FEP)

The monograph’s breakthrough is showing these are not merely analogous—they are **mathematically equivalent**.

In symbols:

```
RSVP fields ≡ Spherepop bubbles ≡ Yarncrawler inference ≡ Free-energy minimization ≡ Self-organizing agents
```

This unification dissolves the silos of science. The laws that describe:

* how fields evolve
* how information compresses
* how agents learn
* how systems persist

are all the *same laws*, expressed in different languages.

This is the engine behind everything else.

## 3. “Life” and “Selfhood” Are Simply the Universe’s Most Stable Patterns

What is a “thing”? What makes an organism or a mind different from a cloud of dust?

The theory defines a **Form** as:

* a persistent pattern
* stable under coarse-graining
* a fixed point of renormalization flow

This means a Form is something that remains identifiable even as fine-grained details are lost—like a forest remaining recognizable even when the leaves blur together.

* A **Form** is a stable, persistent pattern.
* An **Agent** is a Form that performs inference.
* A **Self** is the most stable, most self-predictive agent.

As the monograph puts it:

> “The ontology of RSVP consists not of substances but of fixed points of flows.”

Life, identity, and selfhood are not special ingredients. They are the universe’s most durable patterns—flows that have learned to maintain themselves.

## 4. Meaning Isn’t in Words or Symbols — It’s in the Geometry of What Persists

If a self is simply a pattern that persists, then what makes it persist?

The answer, according to this theory: **meaning itself**.

Meaning is defined not symbolically, but physically:

> “a geometric invariant of semantic flow.”

An invariant is a property that stays the same even as the system changes—like angular momentum in a spinning object.

Meaning, in this theory:

* is not subjective
* is not psychological
* is not linguistic

Meaning is **the conserved quantity of persistence**.

> Meaning is what remains stable while everything else transforms.

This leads to a radical inversion: the universe is not meaningless. It is saturated with meaning—because meaning is simply the geometry of what endures.

## 5. Consciousness Might Be the Slowest, Deepest Hum of a System

Consciousness is notoriously mysterious. The theory offers a bold but precise proposal:

> Consciousness is the slowest eigenmode of semantic flow.

An **eigenmode** is a natural resonant frequency of a system—a stable standing wave. The slowest eigenmode is the most persistent, most globally integrated rhythm.

According to the theory:

* This slow mode binds memory and prediction.
* It provides a stable backdrop against which fleeting perceptions occur.
* It anchors the system’s identity over time.

Thus, consciousness is not something “extra.” It is the deepest, slowest stability in a self-organizing form—the hum that integrates past and future into a continuous experience.

# Conclusion

The overarching vision is of a universe where matter, form, and mind are not separate categories but aspects of a single **variational geometry**.

* The Plenum is a dynamic flow.
* Boundaries (Markov blankets) inevitably arise.
* Forms emerge as stable patterns.
* Agents arise as self-predicting Forms.
* Meaning is the property that persists.
* Consciousness is the deepest, slowest hum of that persistence.

In this view:

We are not alien observers in an indifferent universe.
We are the universe’s own self-organizing patterns becoming aware of themselves.

And it leaves us with one profound question:

> If you are nothing more than a stable pattern, what are the patterns you are fighting to preserve—and what would it mean to let them dissolve?
