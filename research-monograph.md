# **The Ontology of Self-Organizing Forms:

A Unified Variational Field Theory of Structure and Identity**

**Author:** Flyxion
**Date:** November 29, 2025

---

## **Abstract**

This monograph develops a unified mathematical ontology of form, agency, and self-organization grounded in four mutually equivalent theoretical frameworks: the Relativistic Scalar–Vector Plenum (RSVP), the Spherepop combinatorial calculus, the Yarncrawler endofunctor, and the Free Energy Principle (FEP).

We demonstrate that the physical dynamics of the RSVP fields, the combinatorial rules governing Spherepop bubbles, the inferential updates encoded by Yarncrawler, the variational mechanics of the FEP, and the multiscale structure of renormalization flow all converge into a single, cohesive endofunctorial architecture.

The central result is that the stable forms, selves, and agents that populate the RSVP plenum correspond precisely to the fixed points of this unified operator. Identity emerges not as a primary substance but as a renormalization-invariant solution to a variational problem defined jointly by physics, information geometry, and semantic compression.

The outcome is a variational field theory of identity, grounded in entropic geometry, in which the persistence of structure and the emergence of agency arise as necessary consequences of the plenum’s dynamical laws.

# **Part I: Foundational Principles of the Unified Framework**

## **1. Introduction: Unifying Physics, Semantics, and Inference**

The search for a unified theory that explains the emergence and persistence of self-organizing structures—protocells, organisms, minds—spans physics, information theory, computation, and theoretical biology. The present work advances such a theory by deriving the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and the architecture of agentic forms not as supplementary assumptions, but as *inevitable consequences* of a deeper physical–semantic substrate.

The monograph’s central thesis is that the scale-invariant mathematical forms governing self-organizing systems—the “Platonic nature of things,” in Friston’s terminology—correspond exactly to the fixed points of a renormalized semantic evolution operator:

[
T = RG \circ YC,
]

a composite of:

* **RSVP physical evolution**, describing lamphrodynamic flows in a semantic plenum,
* **Yarncrawler compression**, performing variational inference and semantic minimization,
* **renormalization**, implementing scale-invariant coarse-graining.

These components jointly define a single variational geometry. Stable forms, selves, and agents are not fundamental entities but *fixed points* invariant under semantic and physical refinement.

Our exposition proceeds systematically:

1. The **RSVP** framework is developed as the ontic physical substrate.
2. The **Yarncrawler endofunctor** and **Spherepop calculus** provide the semantic–inferential layer.
3. **Markov blankets** are shown to arise as necessary geometric consequences of RSVP field gradients.
4. **Active inference** is derived as intrinsic boundary lamphrodynamics.
5. A series of **equivalence theorems** unites the entire architecture.
6. **Renormalization** reveals why stable forms persist and why identity is scale-invariant.
7. The **philosophical implications** culminate in a triadic ontology of plenum, form, and agent.

We begin by formalizing the physical substrate from which all structure emerges: the Relativistic Scalar–Vector Plenum.

## **2. The Relativistic Scalar–Vector Plenum (RSVP) as Ontic Substrate**

The RSVP framework posits a continuous semantic continuum—a **plenum**—from which all forms arise. It consists of three interacting fields on a differentiable manifold (M):

1. **Scalar density** ( \Phi ): semantic mass or “presence.”
2. **Vector flow** ( v ): lamphrodynamic drive toward coherence.
3. **Entropy potential** ( S ): dispersion, uncertainty, and information-geometric curvature.

These fields follow from the action:

[
A[\Phi, v, S] = \int_M \mathcal{L}(\Phi, v, S, \nabla\Phi, \nabla v, \nabla S) , d^n x,
]

with Lagrangian:

[
\mathcal{L} =
\frac{1}{2}\Phi |v|^2

* \alpha \Phi (\nabla \cdot v)

- \beta |\nabla \Phi|^2
- \gamma |\nabla S|^2
- V(\Phi, S).
  ]

Variation yields the Euler–Lagrange field equations:

[
\partial_t\Phi + \nabla \cdot (\Phi v) = D_\Phi \Delta \Phi + N_\Phi(\Phi, S),
]

[
\partial_t v + (v\cdot \nabla)v = -\nabla\Phi + \mu \Delta v + T(v, S),
]

[
\partial_t S + \nabla \cdot (S v) = D_S \Delta S + N_S(\Phi, v).
]

The **category (R)** of admissible RSVP configurations formalizes the morphisms (physical flows, smoothing, coarse-graining) among field configurations. This category provides the domain on which Yarncrawler and renormalization act.

Ontologically,

* ( \Phi ) encodes semantic mass,
* ( v ) expresses lamphrodynamic drive,
* ( S ) represents uncertainty and dual geometry.

The plenum is thus not empty space but a **semantic dynamical continuum** capable of supporting structure.

## **3. The Yarncrawler Endofunctor and Spherepop Calculus**

The **Yarncrawler endofunctor** ( YC : R \to R ) bridges raw physical dynamics with semantic compression and inferential structure. It acts in three stages:

1. **Physical flow**
   [
   X_{\mathrm{flow}} = \mathrm{Flow}_{\Delta t}(X_t)
   ]
2. **Semantic compression**
   [
   X_{\mathrm{comp}} = \mathrm{Comp}(X_{\mathrm{flow}})
   ]
3. **RSVP projection**
   [
   YC(X_t) = \Pi_{\mathrm{RSVP}}(X_{\mathrm{comp}})
   ]

Spherepop provides a discrete counterpart:

* **Extrusion** → semantic expansion,
* **Merging** → resonance/compression,
* **Popping** → high-pressure collapse.

**Proposition 14.1.**
The total Spherepop semantic pressure (P(B)) is functionally equivalent to variational free energy (F_X) of the corresponding continuous model.

Thus Yarncrawler’s compression step is mathematically equivalent to **natural-gradient descent on free energy**.

# **Part II: The Emergence of Inferential Systems**

## **4. Geometric Emergence of Markov Blankets**

Where RSVP fields form a coherent object (U), the boundary necessarily exhibits steep gradients. This yields the canonical decomposition:

* Internal states (X_{\mathrm{int}}),
* External states (X_{\mathrm{ext}}),
* Boundary states (B = X|\partial U),
* Sensory and active subsets (S_{\mathrm{sens}}, A_{\mathrm{act}}), determined by the sign of (v\cdot n).

**Proposition 2.1.**
[
X_{\mathrm{int}} \perp X_{\mathrm{ext}} \mid (S_{\mathrm{sens}}, A_{\mathrm{act}})
]
Thus **Markov blankets arise as geometric consequences** of RSVP field locality.

Yarncrawler respects and preserves this decomposition: boundary fields are sufficient statistics for semantic updates.

---

## **5. The Free Energy Principle as an Invariant Condition**

Each RSVP configuration induces an internal generative model with variational free energy:

[
F_X[q] = \mathbb{E}_{q(\eta)}[-\log p_X(s,\eta) + \log q(\eta)].
]

Yarncrawler implements the update:

[
\dot{\theta}*X = -G_X^{-1}\nabla*{\theta_X}F_X.
]

Thus:

* free energy decreases monotonically,
* fixed points obey the FEP,
* physically, these are **thermodynamically stable configurations**.

Self-organization emerges naturally from the RSVP–YC architecture.

# **Part III: Geometric and Thermodynamic Synthesis**

## **6. Duality of Thermodynamics and Information Geometry**

The physical entropy field (S(x)) induces the information geometry of the agent.

**Proposition 4.1 (Entropy–Fisher Correspondence).**
[
g_{ij}(\theta) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial\theta_i \partial\theta_j} \int_U S(x;\theta) , dx.
]

**Proposition 9.1.**
The RSVP Hamiltonian (H) is isomorphic to variational free energy (F).

**Proposition 6.1.**
Entropy production = squared natural-gradient norm.

Therefore:

* inference = dissipation = physics,
* lamphrodynamic flow corresponds to geodesic motion in Fisher geometry.

---

## **7. Active Inference as Intrinsic Boundary Lamphrodynamics**

Active inference—minimizing expected free energy—is physically:

* modulation of boundary vector flow (A_{\mathrm{act}}),
* shaping lamphrodynamic flux,
* steering plenum evolution.

**Proposition 7.1.**
Active inference = optimization of boundary lamphrodynamics.

---

# **Part IV: Unification and Its Consequences**

## **8. The Unifying Equivalence Theorem**

**Theorem 8.1 (RSVP–FEP–YC Equivalence).**
For any configuration (X), the following are equivalent:

1. RSVP field evolution
2. Variational free-energy minimization
3. Yarncrawler natural-gradient descent
4. Entropy-production minimization
5. Convergence to fixed point of (T = RG \circ YC)

A broader meta-theorem shows equivalence with Spherepop dynamics, Markov blankets, and Fristonian ontology.

---

## **9. Renormalization, Scaling, and the Emergence of Form**

Renormalization identifies **scale-invariant forms**:

* biological, cognitive, and cosmic patterns,
* nested Markov blankets across scales.

**Proposition 13.1 (Scale Universality).**

If (X) is a renormalization fixed point, its blanket geometry and free-energy structure recur at all higher scales.

---

## **10. Example: Protocell Formation on a Lattice**

Discrete RSVP–Spherepop simulations demonstrate:

* lamphrodynamic smoothing,
* entropy sharpening,
* spontaneous membrane formation,
* tripartite decomposition (interior / boundary / exterior),
* convergence to a stable protocell.

**Theorem (Generic Protocell Emergence).**
Random initial conditions almost surely yield Markov-blanketed entities under repeated application of (T).

---

# **Part V: Philosophical and Ontological Implications**

## **11. A Triadic Ontology: Plenum, Form, Agent**

* **Plenum:** RSVP fields (Φ, v, S).
* **Form:** renormalization-invariant fixed point.
* **Agent:** Form + generative model + active inference.

This yields a unified ontological cycle:
**Plenum ⇒ Form ⇒ Agent**, with feedback via action.

---

## **12. Selfhood, Consciousness, and Meaning**

* **Self:**
  [
  \text{Self} = \lim_{k\to\infty} T^k(X_k)
  ]
* **Consciousness:** slowest eigenmode of YC flow—maximal integration, coherence, predictive horizon.
* **Meaning:** topological invariant of semantic flow.
* **Life:** solution to
  [
  \delta(F + \text{RSVP constraints}) = 0.
  ]

---

## **13. Conclusion: The Entropic Geometry of Self-Organizing Forms**

The monograph unifies:

* RSVP physics,
* Spherepop semantics,
* Yarncrawler inference,
* the Free Energy Principle,
* renormalization of structure.

The resulting identity:

[
\text{RSVP fields} ;\equiv; \text{Spherepop bubbles} ;\equiv; \text{Yarncrawler inference} ;\equiv; \text{Free-energy minimization} ;\equiv; \text{Self-organizing agents}
]

captures the core discovery: all emergent forms—protocells, organisms, minds—are fixed points of a universal variational geometry.
